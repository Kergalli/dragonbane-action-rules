## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances melee/ranged combat and character management in four powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation (Before Roll)**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space
- **Validates weapon range** - Prevents impossible attacks before they happen
- **Smart distance calculation** - Handles multi-grid tokens and diagonal movement correctly
- **Melee range enforcement** - Standard melee weapons require adjacency, long weapons can reach 1 square away
- **Ranged range enforcement** - Ranged weapons can target up x2 their base range

### üìñ **Automatic Rule Display** 
- **Shows combat rules when you need them** - Only on successful special attacks
- **Covers all special actions** - Parry, Topple, Disarm, and Find Weak Spot
- **Weapon durability when parrying** - Shows weapon durability in chat for easy comparison
- **Weapon feature bonuses** - Displays topple weapon bonuses (+1 Boon) automatically
- **Mark Weapon Broken button** - Appears on parry rules for easy weapon damage tracking, updates character sheet directly from chat

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Encumbrance Monitoring**
- **Event-driven monitoring** - Instantly detects when characters become over-encumbered
- **Automatic status effects** - Applies configurable status effects when carrying too many items
- **Smart status effect creation** - Automatically creates custom status effects if they don't exist in the game
- **Folder-based filtering** - Monitor specific actor folders (default: "Party") or all characters
- **Smart notifications** - UI notifications with optional chat reminders about STR roll requirements

### üèÉ **Optional Rule Reminders**
- **Shove mechanics** - Contextual reminders when STR damage bonus allows shoving targets 2m during damage-dealing attacks
- **Parry movement** - Optional reminders about the 2m movement option on successful parries
- **Dodge movement** - Helpful reminders about dodge movement options on successful EVADE rolls
- **Intelligent conditions** - Only shows when rules actually apply (right weapon types, STR advantages, etc.)

## New in Version 1.2.3

### ü•ä **Advanced Optional Rule System**
- **Optional Shove Rule Integration** - Automatic reminders for the optional shove rule when your STR damage bonus ‚â• opponent's
- **Smart Conditions** - Only appears for damage-dealing attacks (excludes Topple/Disarm that don't deal damage)
- **Dodge Movement Reminders** - Shows "If Dodging: You may move up to 2m in any direction (no free attacks triggered)" on successful EVADE rolls
