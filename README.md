## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances tactical combat in two powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space
- **Validates weapon range** - Prevents impossible attacks before they happen
- **Smart distance calculation** - Handles multi-grid tokens and diagonal movement correctly
- **Melee range enforcement** - Standard melee weapons require adjacency, long weapons can reach 1 square away

### üìñ **Automatic Rule Display** 
- **Shows combat rules when you need them** - Only on successful special attacks
- **Covers all special actions** - Parry, Topple, Disarm, and Find Weak Spot
- **Weapon durability when parrying** - Shows weapon durability in chat for easy comparison

## Why You Need This

- ‚ùå Forgetting to select a target before attacking

## Special Cases

**Parrying Long Weapons:** If you're using a standard melee weapon to parry an attack from someone with a long weapon (who is 1 square away), simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.
**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Shield:** When using a shield to parry a ranged attack, simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.
