## Special Cases & Tips

**Spell Exclusions:** Add spell names to the exclusion list (comma-separated) to skip validation while keeping animations. Example: `Protector, Heal Wound, Fireball`

**Manual AA Control:** If automatic spell enhancement causes issues, use the "Disable AA Support" button in settings, then re-enable when ready.

**Template Spells:** Template spells (Engulfing Forest, Frost, Gust of Wind) currently auto-target the caster for visual effects. Proper area targeting will be added in a future version.

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Weapon or Shield:** Target yourself when parrying a ranged attack with a weapon or shield. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:

- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon

**Shove Conditions:** Shove reminders only appear when:

- Using a melee weapon or thrown weapon in melee range
- Attack deals damage (excludes Topple/Disarm)
- Attacker is not a monster
- Target is not a monster
- Attacker's STR damage bonus ‚â• target's STR damage bonus

**Monster Action Prevention:** Prevention dialogs only appear for Parry and Disarm attempts against monsters. All other actions proceed normally.

**Token Action HUD + YZE Integration:** If using the Token Action HUD Dragonbane module, consider adding these exclusions to **YZE Action Exclusions** setting for better action tracking accuracy:

```
Death Roll, Light Test, Lantern Test, Oil Lamp Test, Candle Test, Torch Test, Severe Injury Test
```

## Known Issues

**Template Spell Area Targeting:** Template spells currently auto-target the caster for visual effects rather than placing templates for area targeting. This is intentional for v2.0 - proper template placement will be added in v2.1.

**Socketlib Dependency:** Automatic status effect application requires the socketlib module for proper cross-client communication. If socketlib is not installed, status effects will still work but may not sync properly across all clients.

**Ranged and Thrown Weapons vs Large Tokens:** In the core Dragonbane module, ranged and thrown weapons measure distance to a single reference grid square (upper left) instead of using token bounds. This causes attacks with thrown weapons against large and huge tokens to default to the Throw dialog when attacking from anywhere not adjacent to the upper left grid square of the enemy. This is a limitation of the core system's distance calculation and is outside the scope of this module to fix. **This will be fixed in Dragonbane v2.6**.
