## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances melee/ranged combat in two powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation (Before Roll)**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space
- **Validates weapon range** - Prevents impossible attacks before they happen
- **Smart distance calculation** - Handles multi-grid tokens and diagonal movement correctly
- **Melee range enforcement** - Standard melee weapons require adjacency, long weapons can reach 1 square away
- **Ranged range enforcement** - Ranged weapons can target up x2 their base range

### üìñ **Automatic Rule Display** 
- **Shows combat rules when you need them** - Only on successful special attacks
- **Covers all special actions** - Parry, Topple, Disarm, and Find Weak Spot
- **Weapon durability when parrying** - Shows weapon durability in chat for easy comparison
- **Weapon feature bonuses** - Displays topple weapon bonuses (+1 Boon) automatically
- **Mark Weapon Broken button** - Appears on parry rules for easy weapon damage tracking, updates character sheet directly from chat

## Why You Need This

## New in Version 1.1.0

## Special Cases

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Shield:** When using a shield to parry a ranged attack, simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.
