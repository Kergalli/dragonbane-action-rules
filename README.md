## Usage Examples

### Attack Validation
- **Target Required**: Attempting to attack without a target shows warning and prevents the roll
- **Range Checking**: Attacking beyond weapon range shows distance violation and suggests valid targets
- **Thrown Weapons**: Automatically detects context - uses melee range when adjacent, thrown range when distant

### Rules Display
When you successfully parry, topple, disarm, or find a weak spot, the relevant rules appear automatically with:
- Clear rule descriptions and mechanical effects
- Weapon durability (for parries) to compare against attacker's damage
- "Mark Weapon Broken" button for easy weapon damage tracking
- Weapon feature bonuses (e.g., "+1 Boon for Toppling weapons")

### Monster Action Prevention
- **Attempting Disarm on Monster**: Dialog appears explaining "Monsters cannot be disarmed. Are you sure you want to attempt this disarm against [Monster Name]?"
- **User Options**: Click "Cancel" to prevent the roll entirely, or "Proceed" to allow the action for edge cases
- **Clean Flow**: Single dialog ‚Üí decision ‚Üí complete action without additional interruptions

### Encumbrance Monitoring
- Automatically applies customizable status effects when characters exceed carry capacity
- Provides immediate notifications when encumbrance status changes
- Optional chat reminders about required STR rolls for over-encumbered characters
- Works seamlessly with Dragonbane Status Effects module if installed

### YZE Integration  
- **First Action**: Character makes an attack ‚Üí automatically applies "Single Action" status effect
- **Subsequent Actions**: Additional attacks show contextual notifications and apply "Multiple Actions" effect
- **Smart Detection**: Ignores damage rolls, healing, and advancement - only tracks actual combat actions

## Special Cases & Tips

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Weapon:** Target yourself when parrying a ranged attack with a weapon (not shield). The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Shield:** When using a shield to parry a ranged attack, simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:
- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon

**Shove Conditions:** Shove reminders only appear when:
- Using a melee weapon or thrown weapon in melee range
- Attack deals damage (excludes Topple/Disarm)
- Attacker is not a monster
- Target is not a monster  
- Attacker's STR damage bonus ‚â• target's STR damage bonus

**Monster Action Prevention:** Prevention dialogs only appear for Parry and Disarm attempts against monsters. All other actions proceed normally.

**Token Action HUD + YZE Integration:** If using the Token Action HUD Dragonbane module, consider adding these exclusions to **YZE Action Exclusions** setting for better action tracking accuracy:
```
Death Roll, Light Test, Lantern Test, Oil Lamp Test, Candle Test, Torch Test, Severe Injury Test
```

## Known Issues

**Thrown Weapons vs Large Tokens:** In the core Dragonbane module, thrown weapons measure distance to a single reference grid square (upper left) instead of using token bounds. This causes attacks with thrown weapons against large and huge tokens to default to the Throw dialog when attacking from anywhere not adjacent to the upper left grid square of the enemy. This is a limitation of the core system's distance calculation and is outside the scope of this module to fix. **NOTE: This should be fixed in the next version of the core Dragonbane system.**
