- Clear rule descriptions and mechanical effects

- **Smart Detection**: Ignores damage rolls, healing, and advancement - only tracks actual combat actions

## Special Cases & Tips

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Weapon or Shield:** Target yourself when parrying a ranged attack with a weapon or shield. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:

- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon

**Shove Conditions:** Shove reminders only appear when:

- Using a melee weapon or thrown weapon in melee range
- Attack deals damage (excludes Topple/Disarm)
- Attacker is not a monster
- Target is not a monster
- Attacker's STR damage bonus ‚â• target's STR damage bonus

**Monster Action Prevention:** Prevention dialogs only appear for Parry and Disarm attempts against monsters. All other actions proceed normally.

**Token Action HUD + YZE Integration:** If using the Token Action HUD Dragonbane module, consider adding these exclusions to **YZE Action Exclusions** setting for better action tracking accuracy:

```
Death Roll, Light Test, Lantern Test, Oil Lamp Test, Candle Test, Torch Test, Severe Injury Test
```

## Known Issues

**Thrown Weapons vs Large Tokens:** In the core Dragonbane module, thrown weapons measure distance to a single reference grid square (upper left) instead of using token bounds. This causes attacks with thrown weapons against large and huge tokens to default to the Throw dialog when attacking from anywhere not adjacent to the upper left grid square of the enemy. This is a limitation of the core system's distance calculation and is outside the scope of this module to fix. **NOTE: This should be fixed in the next version of the core Dragonbane system.**
