## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances melee/ranged combat and character management in four powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation (Before Roll)**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space
- **Smart weapon range validation** - Prevents impossible attacks before they happen
- **Contextual thrown weapon support** - Thrown weapons work in melee (up to 2m/4m) AND at range (up to 2x weapon range)
- **Smart distance calculation** - Handles multi-grid tokens and diagonal movement correctly
- **Melee range enforcement** - Standard melee weapons require adjacency, long weapons can reach 1 square away
- **Ranged range enforcement** - Ranged weapons can target up x2 their base range

### üìñ **Automatic Rule Display** 
- **Shows combat rules when you need them** - Only on successful special attacks
- **Covers all special actions** - Parry, Topple, Disarm, and Find Weak Spot
- **Weapon durability when parrying** - Shows weapon durability in chat for easy comparison
- **Weapon feature bonuses** - Displays topple weapon bonuses (+1 Boon) automatically
- **Mark Weapon Broken button** - Appears on parry rules for easy weapon damage tracking, updates character sheet directly from chat

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Encumbrance Monitoring**
- **Event-driven monitoring** - Instantly detects when characters become over-encumbered
- **Automatic status effects** - Applies configurable status effects when carrying too many items
- **Smart status effect creation** - Automatically creates custom status effects if they don't exist in the game
- **Folder-based filtering** - Monitor specific actor folders (default: "Party") or all characters
- **Smart notifications** - UI notifications with optional chat reminders about STR roll requirements

### üèÉ **Optional Rule Reminders**
- **Shove mechanics** - Contextual reminders when STR damage bonus allows shoving targets 2m during damage-dealing attacks
- **Parry movement** - Optional reminders about the 2m movement option on successful parries
- **Dodge movement** - Helpful reminders about dodge movement options on successful EVADE rolls
- **Intelligent conditions** - Only shows when rules actually apply (right weapon types, STR advantages, etc.)

## New in Version 1.2.4

### üó°Ô∏è **Thrown Weapon Support**
- **Contextual Range Validation** - Thrown weapons (daggers, spears, handaxes, etc.) now work correctly at both melee and ranged distances
- **Smart Weapon Detection** - Automatically detects weapons with "Thrown" feature using proper Dragonbane localization
- **Melee + Ranged Capability** - Thrown weapons validate as melee when close (‚â§2m normal, ‚â§4m long) and as ranged when farther
- **Shove Rule Integration** - Thrown weapons can trigger shove reminders when used in melee combat

### üî¨ **Pattern-Based Detection System for Shove Special Rules**
- **Reliability** - Completely rebuilt shove detection using chat message content analysis
- **Language Agnostic** - Uses Dragonbane's own translation keys to work in English, Swedish, and future languages
- **‚úÖ Shove Allowed:** Normal attacks, Stab, Slash, Find Weak Spot (damage-dealing melee)
- **‚ùå Shove Excluded:** Topple, Disarm (no damage), Parry (defensive), Ranged attacks, Spells

## Special Cases

**Thrown Weapons:** The module automatically detects weapons with the "Thrown" feature and validates them contextually:
- **Close Range (‚â§2m normal, ‚â§4m long)**: Validates as melee weapon
- **Far Range (>2m/4m)**: Validates as ranged weapon up to 2x base range
- **Examples**: Dagger at 1m = melee ‚úÖ, Dagger at 8m = thrown ‚úÖ, Dagger at 25m = blocked ‚ùå

**Parrying Long Weapons:** If you're using a standard melee weapon to parry an attack from someone with a long weapon (who is 1 square away), simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Shield:** When using a shield to parry a ranged attack, simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:
- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon

**Shove Conditions:** Shove reminders only appear when:
- Using a melee weapon or thrown weapon in melee range
- Attack deals damage (excludes Topple/Disarm)
- Attacker is not a monster
- Target is not a monster  
- Attacker's STR damage bonus ‚â• target's STR damage bonus
