## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances melee/ranged combat and character management in five powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation (Before Roll)**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space

- **Individual toggles** - Override target selection (Alt+T) or range checking (Alt+R) separately
- **Complete override** - Disable all validation rules at once (Alt+A)
- **Easy reset** - Clear all overrides instantly (Alt+X)

## Special Cases

**Thrown Weapons:** The module automatically detects weapons with the "Thrown" feature and validates them contextually:
- **Close Range (‚â§2m normal, ‚â§4m long)**: Validates as melee weapon
- **Far Range (>2m/4m)**: Validates as ranged weapon up to 2x base range
- **Examples**: Dagger at 1m = melee ‚úÖ, Dagger at 8m = thrown ‚úÖ, Dagger at 25m = blocked ‚ùå

**Year Zero Engine Integration:** When YZE Combat module is installed with single action mode enabled:
- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes all types of actions from chat messages
- **Action Tracking**: Applies appropriate action status effects automatically
- **Reaction Exclusions**: Reaction spells don't count as actions
- **Multiple Actions**: Handles characters with multiple action slots correctly

**Parrying Long Weapons:** If you're using a standard melee weapon to parry an attack from someone with a long weapon (who is 1 square away), simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Parrying Ranged Attacks with a Shield:** When using a shield to parry a ranged attack, simply target yourself when parrying. The range validation will understand you're defending at your position.

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:
- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon

**Shove Conditions:** Shove reminders only appear when:
- Using a melee weapon or thrown weapon in melee range
- Attack deals damage (excludes Topple/Disarm)
- Attacker is not a monster
- Target is not a monster  
- Attacker's STR damage bonus ‚â• target's STR damage bonus

## Known Issues

**Thrown Weapons vs Large Tokens:** In the core Dragonbane module, thrown weapons measure distance to a single reference grid square (upper left) instead of using token bounds. This causes attacks with thrown weapons against large and huge tokens to default to the Throw dialog when attacking from anywhere not adjacent to the upper left grid square of the enemy. This is a limitation of the core system's distance calculation and is outside the scope of this module to fix.
