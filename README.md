## What This Module Does

**Dragonbane Combat Assistant** enhances melee/ranged combat and character management in three powerful ways:

### üéØ **Attack Validation (Before Roll)**
- **Enforces target selection** - No more accidental attacks into empty space
- **Validates weapon range** - Prevents impossible attacks before they happen
- **Smart distance calculation** - Handles multi-grid tokens and diagonal movement correctly
- **Melee range enforcement** - Standard melee weapons require adjacency, long weapons can reach 1 square away
- **Ranged range enforcement** - Ranged weapons can target up x2 their base range

### üìñ **Automatic Rule Display** 
- **Shows combat rules when you need them** - Only on successful special attacks
- **Covers all special actions** - Parry, Topple, Disarm, and Find Weak Spot
- **Weapon durability when parrying** - Shows weapon durability in chat for easy comparison
- **Weapon feature bonuses** - Displays topple weapon bonuses (+1 Boon) automatically
- **Mark Weapon Broken button** - Appears on parry rules for easy weapon damage tracking, updates character sheet directly from chat

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Encumbrance Monitoring**
- **Event-driven monitoring** - Instantly detects when characters become over-encumbered
- **Automatic status effects** - Applies configurable status effects when carrying too many items
- **Folder-based filtering** - Monitor specific actor folders (default: "Party") or all characters
- **Smart notifications** - UI notifications with optional chat reminders about STR roll requirements

## New in Version 1.2.0

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Encumbrance Monitoring System**
- **Instant Response** - Detects over-encumbrance immediately when items are added/removed or actor strength changes
- **Smart Status Effects** - Automatically applies configurable status effects when characters exceed carrying capacity
- **Configurable Monitoring** - Choose which actor folder to monitor or monitor all characters
- **Rule Integration** - Optional chat notifications that remind players about STR roll requirements for over-encumbered movement

### üéõÔ∏è **Enhanced Configuration Options**
- **Enable Encumbrance Monitoring** - Master on/off switch for the encumbrance system
- **Monitor Folder Setting** - Specify which actor folder to monitor (leave blank for all characters)
- **Custom Status Effect** - Configure the status effect name applied when over-encumbered
- **Chat Notifications** - Optional chat messages with rule reminders (disabled by default for minimal disruption)

### üåç **Full Internationalization Support**

**Marking Weapons Broken:** The "Mark Weapon Broken" button only appears on parry rules when:
- A valid weapon was detected for the parry
- The weapon is not already broken
- You have permission to modify the weapon
