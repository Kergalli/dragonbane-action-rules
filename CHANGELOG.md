### Known Issues

- **Thrown Weapons vs Large Tokens**: In the core Dragonbane module, thrown weapons measure distance to a single reference grid square (upper left) instead of using token bounds. This causes attacks with thrown weapons against large and huge tokens to default to the Throw dialog when attacking from anywhere not adjacent to the upper left grid square of the enemy. This is a limitation of the core system's distance calculation and is outside the scope of this module to fix.
